# Exploring-Extractive-Question-Answering-Model
Exploring pre-trained TF and Pytorch extractive question answering model

**Note: could not upload `glove/glove.6B.100d.txt` due to filesize**

## Objectives
* You will use a variation of the Transformer model you built in the last assignment to answer questions about stories.
* You will implement extractive QA model in TensorFlow and in PyTorch.
